# Operators : Type Conversion - Sign Bit Extension

## Description

Symbols that instructs the compiler to perform specific arithmetic or logical operation on operands All C operators do 2 things:

- Operates on its operands
- Returns a value

Operators play a very crucial role in controlling the system behavior in general. 
There are different types of Operators available in C Programming Language. 
When and expression gets evaluated, based on the objects we deal would lead to implicit type conversion. 
This example demonstrates explicit type promotion.
